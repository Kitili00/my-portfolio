        <h1>Introduction</h1>
            </header>

        <p>Cristiano Ronaldo was born in <strong>Madeira Island,Portugal</strong> in 1986. He was born in a <em>humble family</em> where his father was a kitman for Portugal's mens National Team.
            His upbringing was tough since he had to <strong>sweep the streets</strong> so as to have something to eat. He comes from a family of 3;including his brother Mateo and sister Juliana
            He has been raised in a family that believes in christianity and it is noted that his mother was a very religious woman who prayed for her children everyday. 
            His dad however was a drunkard who gave his life away to <em>hedonistic lifestyle.</em> This however was not a problem to Cristiano because he had set his mind to being a successful baller.

        <h2>Early Life</h2>
            </header>
        <p>As his father;Jovic, was a kitman, Cristiano fell in love with football at the age of 5. He used to join his father on the pitch after the team's training session was over and train with his dad.
            On one training session, a scout for <strong>Sporting Lisbon</strong>; Portugal's biggest team; saw Cristiano's potential and decided to put in a good word for him and he got his first professional contract at the team's academy at age 7.
            His family was very proud and happy for him. His dedication for the sport however did not stop there as we will see later on his career.

        <h3>Career Path</h3>
        <p>After joining <em>Sporting Lisbon</em>, his dedication did not stop there as he continued to put his best foot forward to be better as a person and as a player. He had no other motivation apart from his hunger and mentality to win everything.
            He joined Lisbon's A team and as always he aced everything from the pitch and became the best of the best in that team. He attracted great teams at the time like<strong>Manchester United</strong>and joined them in 2005. Sir Alex Ferguson, the manager, fell in love with his playing style and his hunger from a 21 year old.
            He therefore continued mentoring him both on the pitch and his personal life. This made them form a very strong bond that was unbreakable. They won everything from championships, European Cups and even conquered the championship twice.
            This propelled Ronaldo's name in the world stage and he even won a <strong>Ballon D'OR</strong>, the most <em>prestigious</em>individual award that one can receive.
            It also helped propel his name to <abbr title="Cristiano Ronaldo 7">CR7</abbr></p>

          <h3>Controversy</h3>
          As it is with any man trying to make it in the world, controversy will never miss from your life. It has been alleged that Cristiano has raped women. This charges were instantly dropped because they were vague and the women accusing him were just trying to extort him money.
          He later addressed this issue that once you reach the epitome of your career, haters will always appear trying to destroy you.
